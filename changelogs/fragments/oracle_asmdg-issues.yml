bugfixes:
  - "oracle_asmdg.py: wanted_attributes casted to list to reflect change in zip object type"
  - "oracle_asmdg.py: compare sorted current_properties to sorted wanted_attributes, because we shouldn't rely on the list order of asm_diskgroups' attributes list is the same as querying v$asm_attribute returns"
  - "oracle_asmdg.py: exclude read_only attributes when building current_properties from v$asm_attribute as they're also removed from wanted_attributes"
