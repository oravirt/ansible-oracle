bugfixes:
  - "orahost_storage: Ensure `oracle_asm_disk_string` directory exists in udev.yml (oravirt#555)"
  - "orahost_storage: Get scsi id of unpartitioned devices from device itself instead of parent device in setup-udev.sh.j2 (oravirt#555)"
  - "oraswgi_install: With udev device persistence, grid-install templates shouldn't build asm diskgroups from the devices but from their device mapper aliases instead (which reflect oracle_asm_disk_string) (oravirt#555)"
minor_changes:
  - "oraasm_manage_diskgroups: Support for empty `device_persistence` added to `_oraasm_manage_diskgroups_asmdevice_list`, e.g. if Oracle files are on NFS (oravirt#555)"
  - "orahost_storage: Added support for unpartitioned dm-devices and partitions to setup-udev.sh.j2. Both don't have scsi ids. (oravirt#555)"
  - "oraswgi_install: Added support for empty `device_persistence` to grid-install templates (oravirt#555)"
  - "oraswgi_meta: Assert extended by `device_persistence: udev` and empty `device_persistence` (oravirt#555)"
