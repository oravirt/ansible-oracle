== How to develop in `ansible-oracle`?

IMPORTANT: This is an example how most of the development in `ansible-oracle` is done. +
A Pull-Request is only accepted, when `github-Actions` are valid.

=== Prepare a development environment

IMPORTANT: This chapter shows, how the development envionment could look like. +
You need an Ansible-Controller with an Editor or IDE of your own choice.



=== Create Fork on github and contribute to the project

link:https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects[github] has a great documentation with details about creating a fork and branch to contribute to `ansible-oracle`.

IMPORTANT: The `github-Actions` will automatically start, when the branchname starts with `pr` or in each Pull-Request. +
Please use a branch with 'pr'--prefix, when `ansible-lint` should be checked for each commit.

=== pre-commit

IMPORTANT: link:https://pre-commit.com/[pre-commit] is a nice tool for git. +
Each commit is locally checked against multiple rules, to prevent failures in github-Actions after pushing commits to github. +
This tool is recommended but not mandatory for contributing to `ansible-oracle`.

.Installation (cd into repository before)
----
pip install --user pre-commit
pre-commit install
----

.run outside git
----
pre-commit run
----

=== Ansible Navigator

IMPORTANT: python3 should point to Python >=3.9, otherwise ansible-navigator and ansible-lint could not beused. +
The `activate` script is used to change the Python environment in current shell.

.configure venv for ansible-oracle
----
python3.10 -V

Python 3.10.6

python3.10 -m venv ~/venv/ansible-oracle
----

.install Python modules
----
. ~/venv/ansible-oracle/bin/activate
pip --require-virtualenv -v install -r requirements_dev.txt
----

.Start ansible-navigator
----
. ~/venv/ansible-oracle/bin/activate
ansible-navigator --version

ansible-navigator 3.3.0
----

=== Using ansible-doctor

IMPORTANT: `ansible-doctor` has har dmodule dpendencies with conflicts between `ansible-lint`.
We have to use a dedicated venv for `ansible-doctor'

.configure venv for ansible-oracle
----
python3 -m venv ~/venv/ansible-doctor
----

.install Python modules
----
. ~/venv/ansible-doctor/bin/activate
pip --require-virtualenv -v install -r requirements_doctor.txt
----

.Start ansible-doctor
----
~/venv/ansible-doctor/bin/ansible-doctor --version

ansible-doctor 2.0.4
----

IMPORTANT: Do not forget to place change files in stage area of git before starting `pre-commit`. +
`pre-commit` works only on the data of the stage area! +
`pre-commit` could be executed without an active venv.


.Start ansible-doctor with pre-commit
----
pre-commit run ansible-doctor
----

.Start ansible-doctor to create new README.md file
----
cd ansible-oracle
~/venv/ansible-doctor/bin/ansible-doctor -f -r roles
----

=== Start Ansible-Container

IMPORTANT: Replaced by `ansible-navigator` and `venv`.

=== Start Playbook

IMPORTANT: Don't forget to set the working branch in `requirements.yml`. +
Remove/Disable `devsec.hardening` for faster installation of Ansible collection, when devsec should not be tested.


.Edit requirements.yml
----
---
collections:
  # - name: devsec.hardening
  #   version: 8.2.0
  - name: https://github.com/Rendanic/ansible-oracle.git
    type: git
    version: devbranch
----

.Execute ansible-playbook
----
ansible-galaxy collection install --force -r requirements.yml && ansible-playbook -i inventory/hasfd -e hostgroup='all' playbooks/single-instance-asm.yml --limit '*19c*'
----

== Pull-Requests

=== Important Information

The ansible-oracle project introduced `antsibull-changelog` for managing the `CHANGELOG.rst` based on fragments in `changelogs/gragments`.

The ID should point to the PR and the filename describe the PR in short form.
The fragments are part of the PR.
If multiple PRs are open, the upper rule makes sure that no duplicate files are created during merge.

IMPORTANT: Each Pull-Requests needs a fragment from Release 3.0.0 onwards!

== Create new Releases in `ansible-oracle`

IMPORTANT: This is only needed for creating new Releases in `ansible-oracle` - not for development!


=== Install antsibull-changelog

----
cd ansible-oracle/docker
docker-compose run --rm -w /git/ansible-oracle/example/beginner/ansible ansible bash

pip3 install antsibull-changelog
----

=== Working with antsibull-changelog

Changelogs for Collections: https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/blob/main/docs/changelogs.rst#releasing-a-new-version-of-a-collection

=== Creating new releases

`antsibull-changelog release` reads `galaxy.yml` to get the release version automatically.
The execution is aborted, when a release with the version is existing in `CHANGELOG.rst`.

NOTE: The whole release process should be donw with a dedicated Pull-Request.

----
antsibull-changelog release
----

== Update Vagrantbox on vagrantcloud for examples

IMPORTANT: This is only an example how to do it, when custom images should be used.

=== Create new Box

----
git clone https://github.com/Rendanic/bento.git
cd bento
git checkout oc
cd packer_templates/oraclelinux/
./oc_oracle-7.x_vbox.sh oracle-7.9-x86_64.json
----

=== Upload new Version

IMPORTANT: Change the boxname to an account with write priviledges.

.Upload new version after build:
----
boxname="Rendanic/oraclelinux-7.x"
vagrantversion=$(date +%y%m%d)

vagrant cloud version create ${boxname} "$vagrantversion"
vagrant cloud provider create ${boxname} virtualbox "$vagrantversion"
vagrant cloud provider upload ${boxname} virtualbox "$vagrantversion" ../../builds/oracle-7.9.virtualbox.box
vagrant cloud publish --release ${boxname} "$vagrantversion" virtualbox
----

== ansible molecule

WARNING: The timeout for pulling docker Container in `molecule` is 15s at the moment. +
There is no parameter to increase the timeout. Pull container manually before starting the szenario. The image url is defined in `molecule.yml`.

The following szenarios are existing in the `ansible-oracle profect.

[options="header" cols="1,4" valign="top"]
|=======================
|Stage |Description
| dbfs | Full stage for installation of RDBMS 19c + Patching and create database. Requires installation media in /vagrant on local host.
| default | Stage for testing common and orahost roles with different Distributions.
| download | Download Patches from support.oracle.com for dbfs stage.
|=======================

=== Test OS roles

IMPORTANT: This szenario is used, when changes at OS roles should be tested against different OS Distribuitions. +
Most of the tests are included in the `dbfs` szenario!

The execution time is ~10m for a full test.

The `default` szenario requires no parameter `-s`!

.Start download
----
cd extensions
molecule test
----

=== Download Patches for `dbfs` stage

IMPORTANT: Make sure that /vagrant has enough free space for installation media and patches.

.set environment variables for support.oracle.com login
----
export MOS_LOGIN=Username
export MOS_PASSWORD=verySecret
----

.Start download
----
cd extensions
molecule test -s download
----

`molecule test` does the full test of the szenario.

=== Test Single Instance in Filesystem with szenario `dbfs`

IMPORTANT: Make sure that the installation media and patches are placed in `/vagrant` before starting `molecule`. +
Use the szenario `download` for downloading the Patches from support.oracle.com.


The execution time is ~2h for a full test.

.Start download
----
cd extensions
molecule test -s dbfs
----

=== Oracle XE (not used at the moment!)

IMPORTANT: This chapter was designed for testing the `oradb_managed_`-Roles. +
It is not clear if this will be added or not.

.Docker pull Oracle XE

Normal SSO-Login from Oracle is needed for login to docker registry.

----
docker login container-registry.oracle.com
docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/express:21.3.0-xe
----

.Start Oracle Container for test
----
docker run -d --name oracle-xe \
  -e ORACLE_PWD=Oracle_123 \
  -p 1521:1521 \
  container-registry.oracle.com/database/express:21.3.0-xe
