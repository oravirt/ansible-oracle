= Ansible as a Docker Container

The development and test of `ansible-oracle` is done in a Docker Container.
This allows a simple switch between ansible versions and an easy implementation at a customer site, because you can use your own chosen version of Ansible for `ansible-oracle`.

Requirements:

- Docker

- docker-compose
- ssh-agent +
The ssh-agent is configured inside the docker-compose.yml.
It simplifies the connection to the target machines via SSH.

== Build

----
cd docker
docker-compose build
----

== Start Container

----
cd docker
docker-compose run --rm ansible bash
----

== Install Collection

IMPORTANT: `ansible-oracle` is designed to run as a container.

----
cd docker
docker-compose run --rm ansible bash
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
----
